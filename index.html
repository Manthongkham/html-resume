    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        After serving in the U.S. Army for more than 4 years, 
        I am inspired and motivated to continue my academic career. 
        My military career has instilled integrity, self-discipline and 
        ambition that will greatly benefit in my future as a computer 
        science student with special interests in Software Engineering. 
        Upon enrolling for undergraduate studies in Fall 2022, I am 
        interested in any internships or temporary work positions.
